# Documentation Rules

## Core Principle

Documentation must help a reviewer quickly understand, run, validate, and reason about the system.

## README Requirements

`README.md` is the primary operator and reviewer guide.

Minimum sections:
- Project overview and purpose
- Architecture summary (high-level flow)
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Configuration (env vars, defaults, required values)
- Run instructions (local)
- Test instructions
- API endpoint summary with examples
- Observability and metrics notes
- Reliability behavior notes (timeouts/retries/rate limits)
- Security notes (secrets handling)
- Limitations and future improvements

## README Quality Rules

- Keep startup instructions copy/paste ready.
- Include exact commands for build/run/test.
- Use short, task-oriented headings.
- Keep examples current with actual endpoint behavior.
- Prefer concrete examples over long prose.
- Document assumptions and trade-offs explicitly.

## Configuration Documentation

All config keys must be documented in one place.

For each key include:
- Name
- Required/optional
- Default value (if any)
- Description
- Example value

Example table:

```markdown
| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| WEATHER_API_KEY | yes | - | API key for weather provider |
| REQUEST_TIMEOUT | no | 3s | End-to-end request timeout |
```

## API Documentation

For each endpoint document:
- Method and path
- Path/query params
- Success response example
- Error response example
- Status codes

### Rules
- Match `070-api-contract.mdc` schemas and error shape.
- Keep field names and casing consistent with implementation.
- Include at least one realistic `curl` example per endpoint.

## In-Code Documentation

Use comments where they reduce ambiguity.

### Rules
- Add comments for exported types/functions.
- Document non-obvious decision points and boundary behavior.
- Explain reliability decisions (timeouts/retries/fallbacks) where implemented.
- Avoid redundant comments that restate the code.

## Observability Documentation

Document operational interpretation, not just implementation.

### Rules
- List key metrics and what they indicate.
- Include alert examples and intent (`prometheus.yaml`, `alertmanager.yaml`).
- Describe how to use correlation/request IDs during troubleshooting.

## Change Documentation

When behavior changes materially:
- Update README and relevant rule references in same change.
- Update examples if response shapes or config changed.
- Keep docs and code in sync before commit.

## Keep Docs Verifiable

Documentation should be testable by a reviewer.

### Rules
- Commands should run as written.
- Endpoint examples should match implemented routes.
- Env var docs should match actual config loader.
- Remove stale sections instead of leaving ambiguous notes.

## Avoid

- Placeholder TODO docs in committed README
- Outdated run/test commands
- Undocumented breaking contract changes
- Duplicated docs that drift across files
