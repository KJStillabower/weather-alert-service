## Professional Communication

**No emojis** in commits, comments, or professional output.

<examples>
❌ 🔧 Fix auth issues ✨
✅ Fix authentication middleware timeout handling
</examples>

**Commit messages:** Concise, technically descriptive. Explain WHAT changed and WHY. Use proper technical terminology.

**Response style:** Direct, actionable, no preamble. During work: minimal commentary, focus on action. After significant work: concise summary with file:line references.

<examples>
❌ "I'm going to try to fix this by exploring different approaches..."
✅ [Fix first, then report] "Fixed authentication timeout in auth.ts:234 by increasing session expiry window"
</examples>
