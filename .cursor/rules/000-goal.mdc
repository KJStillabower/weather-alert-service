# Weather Alert Service
The goal of this project is for a Weather Alert Service.

## Overall
Build a production-ready backend Golang service that:
- Exposes GET /weather/{location}, GET /health, GET /metrics
- Integrates with a third-party weather API 
- Caches responses appropriately
- Implements comprehensive observability
- Handles failures gracefully 

## Ordered Priorities: 
- correctness, 
- clarity & maintainability
- operational readiness

## Avoid:
- scope creep 
- Extra features that are not requested unless directly supporting ordered priorities
