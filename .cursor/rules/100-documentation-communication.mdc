# Documentation and Communication Rules

## Core Principle

Professional communication standards apply to commits, code, and documentation. Documentation must help a reviewer quickly understand, run, validate, and reason about the system.

## Professional Communication

**No emojis** in commits, comments, or professional output.

<examples>
❌ 🔧 Fix auth issues ✨
✅ Fix authentication middleware timeout handling
</examples>

**Commit messages:** Concise, technically descriptive. Explain WHAT changed and WHY. Use proper technical terminology.

**Response style:** Direct, actionable, no preamble. During work: minimal commentary, focus on action. After significant work: concise summary with file:line references.

<examples>
❌ "I'm going to try to fix this by exploring different approaches..."
✅ [Fix first, then report] "Fixed authentication timeout in auth.ts:234 by increasing session expiry window"
</examples>

## Commit Message Format

**Follow conventional commit structure:**

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<trailers>
```

**Subject line (required):**
- 50 characters or less
- Imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- No period at end
- Capitalize first letter
- Describe WHAT changed

**Body (optional but recommended for non-trivial changes):**
- Explain WHY the change was made
- Provide context or rationale
- Reference related issues or decisions
- Separate from subject with blank line
- Concise, technically descriptive
- Use proper technical terminology
- No emojis

**Examples:**

```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Simple change
git commit -m "Add correlation ID middleware"

# ✅ GOOD - With body explaining why
git commit -m "Add correlation ID middleware

Implements request tracing per 050-observability.mdc.
Enables correlation IDs for all HTTP requests to support
debugging and log correlation across service boundaries."

# ✅ GOOD - With model co-author trailer
git commit -m "Add correlation ID middleware

Implements request tracing per 050-observability.mdc.

Co-authored-by: Cursor Auto <ai@cursor.com>"

# ❌ BAD
git commit -m "fix stuff"  # Too vague
git commit -m "Added correlation ID middleware."  # Past tense, period
git commit -m "WIP"  # Work in progress commits
```

## Commit Types

**Use conventional commit types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no behavior change)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (deps, config, etc.)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)

```bash
# ✅ GOOD
feat: Add Prometheus metrics endpoint
fix: Handle nil pointer in cache lookup
docs: Update README with setup instructions
refactor: Extract weather client to separate package

# ❌ BAD
update: Fix bug  # Use 'fix' instead
change: Add metrics  # Use 'feat' instead
```

## Commit Message Content

**What to include:**
- What component/feature changed
- Why the change was necessary
- Reference to relevant rules or requirements when applicable

**What NOT to include:**
- Implementation details (code shows this)
- Obvious information ("Fixed bug" without context)
- Emojis or casual language

## Commit Trailers

**Use trailers for metadata:**

**Co-authored-by:** For AI-assisted commits or multiple contributors.  
If a model is pinned in the UI, use that exact model name in the trailer.  

**Pinned-model example:**
```bash
Co-authored-by: GPT-5.3 Codex <ai@cursor.com>
```

**Unknown-model/auto example:**
If the model is not known, use `Cursor Auto`.
```bash
Co-authored-by: Cursor Auto <ai@cursor.com>
```

**Fixes/Closes:** Reference issues:
```bash
Fixes: #123
Closes: #456
```

**Example commit with trailers:**

```bash
git commit -m "fix: Handle API timeout errors gracefully

Implements retry logic with exponential backoff per
060-reliability.mdc. Prevents cascading failures when
external weather API is slow.

Co-authored-by: GPT-5.3 Codex <ai@cursor.com>"
```

## Atomic Commits

**One logical change per commit:**

```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Atomic commits
git commit -m "feat: Add cache implementation"
git commit -m "feat: Add cache metrics"
git commit -m "docs: Document cache configuration"

# ❌ BAD - Multiple unrelated changes
git commit -m "Add cache and fix bug and update docs"
```

**When to combine:**
- Related changes that must be together
- Fixing a bug introduced in same commit
- Documentation for feature in same commit

**When to separate:**
- Unrelated features
- Different concerns (logic vs. tests vs. docs)
- Changes that can be reviewed independently

## Pre-Commit Checklist

**Before committing, verify:**
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in code (090-security.mdc)
- [ ] No `.env` files or sensitive data staged
- [ ] Commit message follows format
- [ ] Changes are atomic and logical
- [ ] Code compiles/builds successfully
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)

## Branching Strategy

**For this take-home project:**
- Use `main` branch for all work
- No feature branches required unless explicitly requested
- Keep history clean and linear when possible

**If branching becomes necessary:**
- Use descriptive branch names: `feat/cache-implementation`
- Keep branches short-lived
- Rebase before merging to maintain clean history

## Commit Frequency

**Commit often, but meaningfully:**
- After completing a logical unit of work
- After fixing a bug
- After adding a feature
- After significant refactoring

**Avoid:**
- Committing broken code
- Committing work-in-progress with "WIP" messages
- Squashing unrelated changes into one commit

## Security Considerations

**Per 090-security.mdc, never commit:**
- API keys or credentials
- `.env` files
- Secrets or sensitive configuration
- Hardcoded passwords

**If secrets are accidentally committed:**
- Rotate credentials immediately
- Remove from git history
- Never force-push without coordination

## README Requirements

`README.md` is the primary operator and reviewer guide.

Minimum sections:
- Project overview and purpose
- Architecture summary (high-level flow)
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Configuration (env vars, defaults, required values)
- Run instructions (local)
- Test instructions
- API endpoint summary with examples
- Observability and metrics notes
- Reliability behavior notes (timeouts/retries/rate limits)
- Security notes (secrets handling)
- Limitations and future improvements

## README Quality Rules

- Keep startup instructions copy/paste ready.
- Include exact commands for build/run/test.
- Use short, task-oriented headings.
- Keep examples current with actual endpoint behavior.
- Prefer concrete examples over long prose.
- Document assumptions and trade-offs explicitly.

## Configuration Documentation

All config keys must be documented in one place.

For each key include:
- Name
- Required/optional
- Default value (if any)
- Description
- Example value

Example table:

```markdown
| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| WEATHER_API_KEY | yes | - | API key for weather provider |
| REQUEST_TIMEOUT | no | 3s | End-to-end request timeout |
```

## API Documentation

For each endpoint document:
- Method and path
- Path/query params
- Success response example
- Error response example
- Status codes

### Rules
- Match `070-api-contract.mdc` schemas and error shape.
- Keep field names and casing consistent with implementation.
- Include at least one realistic `curl` example per endpoint.

## In-Code Documentation

Use comments where they reduce ambiguity.

### Rules
- Add comments for exported types/functions.
- Document non-obvious decision points and boundary behavior.
- Explain reliability decisions (timeouts/retries/fallbacks) where implemented.
- Avoid redundant comments that restate the code.

## Observability Documentation

Document operational interpretation, not just implementation.

### Rules
- List key metrics and what they indicate.
- Include alert examples and intent (`prometheus.yaml`, `alertmanager.yaml`).
- Describe how to use correlation/request IDs during troubleshooting.

## Change Documentation

When behavior changes materially:
- Update README and relevant rule references in same change.
- Update examples if response shapes or config changed.
- Keep docs and code in sync before commit.

## Keep Docs Verifiable

Documentation should be testable by a reviewer.

### Rules
- Commands should run as written.
- Endpoint examples should match implemented routes.
- Env var docs should match actual config loader.
- Remove stale sections instead of leaving ambiguous notes.

## Avoid

- Placeholder TODO docs in committed README
- Outdated run/test commands
- Undocumented breaking contract changes
- Duplicated docs that drift across files
- Emojis in commits, comments, or professional output
- Committing broken code or work-in-progress
- Vague commit messages without context
